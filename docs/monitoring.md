# shortly monitoring

This adds the Prometheus Community `kube-prometheus-stack` Helm chart, the app's Prometheus `ServiceMonitor`, six Shortly alert rules, and a Grafana dashboard provisioned from a labeled ConfigMap. The chart is pinned to **91.8.2** (chart app version `v0.94.1`). Grafana and Prometheus are exposed with port-forward only; no additional Ingress or host mapping is needed.

## Architecture

    A[shortly app pods] --> S[shortly Service]
    S --> SM[ServiceMonitor in urlshortener]

    K --> D[Deployment, Pod and HPA metrics]
    D --> P
```

Prometheus scrapes the app's `/metrics` endpoint and kube-state-metrics. Grafana discovers dashboard ConfigMaps across namespaces by the `grafana_dashboard="1"` label. Prometheus evaluates the Shortly rules and sends firing state to Alertmanager; the configured `null` receiver keeps this local demo notification-free.

## Prerequisites and first-time setup

Start from the repository root. Phase 2's `shortly` Minikube profile and app in `urlshortener` must already be running. Docker Desktop should give Minikube about 6 GiB and four CPUs. Install the Helm CLI if it is not already present. The `monitoring-up` target adds/updates the Prometheus Community repository, installs the pinned chart, then server-side applies the custom resources.

```sh
make k8s-up
make build-all
make load-all
ADMIN_TOKEN='demo-admin-token' make deploy
make monitoring-up
make monitoring-status
make traffic DURATION=120
make check-dashboard
make alerts
```

`CHART_VERSION` defaults to `91.8.2`; update it intentionally after checking a stable release with `helm repo update` and `helm search repo prometheus-community/kube-prometheus-stack --versions`. `MON_NS`, `PROM_SVC`, and `GRAFANA_SVC` are Make variables if the Helm release is customized. `monitoring/` has no global namespace transformer: the ServiceMonitor is explicitly in `urlshortener`, while the PrometheusRule and generated dashboard ConfigMap are explicitly in `monitoring`.

## Accessing the UIs

Run each target in its own terminal and keep it running:

```sh
make grafana       # http://localhost:3000, admin / demo-grafana-pass
make prometheus    # http://localhost:9090
make alertmanager  # http://localhost:9093
```

The Grafana password is a **local demo credential only**. Grafana has no PVC; its dashboards and datasources are provisioned. To verify the dashboard through Grafana's API after `make grafana` is running:

```sh
curl -fsS -u admin:demo-grafana-pass 'http://localhost:3000/api/search?query=Shortly'
```

The result should include `Shortly / Overview` without a manual import. Repeat the API check after `make monitoring-down monitoring-up` to confirm it is provisioned again.

## PromQL cheat sheet

Dashboard Prometheus datasource UID is `prometheus`, read from the live Grafana API. The app target carries `namespace`, `pod`, `service`, and `job`; the actual job value is **`shortly`**. Use these common selectors throughout:

- `APP = job="shortly", namespace="urlshortener"`
- `REAL = handler!~"/healthz|/readyz"` (removes Kubernetes probe traffic from user-request rates, availability, and latency)

| Panel | Query | What it shows |
|---|---|---|
| Pods UP | `sum(up{APP})` | Healthy app scrape targets, one per Ready replica. |
| Availability (5m) | `100 * (1 - (5xx rate / total rate))` over `[5m]`, with zero-safe guards | Percentage of real requests without a 5xx. |
| Request rate | `sum(rate(http_requests_total{APP,REAL}[1m]))` | Real requests per second. |
| Error rate (5xx %) | `100 * sum(rate(http_requests_total{APP,REAL,status=~"5.."}[1m])) / clamp_min(sum(rate(http_requests_total{APP,REAL}[1m])),1e-9) or vector(0)` | Zero-safe 5xx percentage. |
| p95 latency | `histogram_quantile(0.95,sum by (le)(rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{APP,REAL}[1m])))` | p95 real-request latency. The live `/metrics` check confirmed this handler-labeled histogram includes the `le="0.5"` bucket. |
| Redis up | `min(shortly_redis_up{APP}) or vector(0)` | Redis reachability gauge; 0 maps to DOWN, 1 to UP. |
| Running versions | `count by (version)(shortly_build_info{APP})` | App pod count by image-provided release version. |
| Request rate by status | `sum by (status)(rate(http_requests_total{APP,REAL}[1m]))` | Stacked requests per second by exact HTTP status. |
| 4xx rate | `sum(rate(http_requests_total{APP,REAL,status=~"4.."}[1m]))` | Client and validation errors per second. |
| 5xx rate | `sum(rate(http_requests_total{APP,REAL,status=~"5.."}[1m]))` | Server errors per second; empty is normal when healthy. |
| Latency p50/p95/p99 | `histogram_quantile(0.50|0.95|0.99,sum by (le)(rate(http_request_duration_seconds_bucket{APP,REAL}[1m])))` | Real-request latency percentiles and a 0.5-second threshold. |
| 5xx percentage | Same zero-safe ratio as Error rate (5xx %) | Error percentage over time with a 5% threshold. |
| Request rate by handler | `sum by (handler)(rate(http_requests_total{APP,REAL}[1m]))` | Normalized route templates such as `/{code}`, not raw short codes. |
| Request rate by pod | `sum by (pod)(rate(http_requests_total{APP,REAL}[1m]))` | Load distribution across app replicas. |
| Pod uptime | `time() - process_start_time_seconds{APP,pod!=""}` | Seconds since each app process started. |
| Pod restarts | `sum by (pod)(increase(kube_pod_container_status_restarts_total{namespace="urlshortener",pod=~"shortly-.*",container="shortly"}[5m]))` | App container restart increases; an empty result is normal with no restarts. |
| Deployment and HPA replicas | `kube_deployment_status_replicas_available`, `kube_deployment_spec_replicas`, `kube_horizontalpodautoscaler_status_current_replicas`, `kube_horizontalpodautoscaler_status_desired_replicas` filtered to `urlshortener/shortly` | Available/desired Deployment and current/desired HPA counts. These kube-state-metrics names were queried from the installed Prometheus. |
| CPU per app pod | `sum by (pod)(rate(container_cpu_usage_seconds_total{namespace="urlshortener",pod=~"shortly-.*",cpu="total"}[1m]))` plus `kube_pod_container_resource_requests{namespace="urlshortener",pod=~"shortly-.*",container="shortly",resource="cpu",unit="core"}` | Pod CPU usage and the 0.1-core request. The Minikube cAdvisor series has namespace/pod labels but no `container` label, so the usage selector intentionally omits it. |
| Business rates/min | `sum(rate(shortly_links_created_total{APP}[1m]))*60` (also redirects, rate limited, and blocked counters) | Links created, successful redirects, rate-limited requests, and blocked destination attempts per minute. |

The dashboard annotation query is `ALERTS{alertname=~"Shortly.*",alertstate="firing"}` and marks firing Shortly alerts on the time-series panels.

## Alert rules

All custom rules are evaluated every 15 seconds. Demo `for:` periods are intentionally short; in production, use longer windows to avoid flapping and allow for transient recovery.

| Alert | Condition and `for` | Demo scenario | Resolve |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ShortlyHighErrorRate` | Real 5xx ratio >5% and >0.5 requests/s for 1m | Chaos errors or `make bad-release-errors` | Reset chaos with `DELETE /admin/chaos` or run `make rollback`. |
| `ShortlyHighLatencyP95` | Real p95 >0.5s with >0.5 requests/s for 1m | Chaos latency | Reset chaos with `DELETE /admin/chaos`. |
| `ShortlyPodsNotReady` | `kube_deployment_status_replicas_unavailable > 0` for 1m | Redis down; may also appear during a prolonged crash rollout | `make redis-up` or `make rollback`. |
| `ShortlyPodCrashLooping` | App container restart increase during 5m for 1m | `make bad-release-crash` | `make rollback`. |
| `ShortlyRedisDown` | Redis gauge is 0 or the app metrics target disappears for 30s | `make redis-down` | `make redis-up`. |
| `ShortlyTargetDown` | An app scrape target is down or absent for 1m | App endpoint/ServiceMonitor outage | Restore Ready app endpoints and inspect `make monitoring-status`. |

Every alert has `severity` and `app: shortly` labels plus a summary and resolution-oriented description. The traffic guards prevent idle intervals from causing rate/latency alerts.

## Demo scenarios and dashboard panels

Run `make traffic DURATION=120` in a separate terminal while triggering a scenario. The throwaway generator creates and redirects links, then samples 404, 409, 422, and 403 responses; one short same-IP burst produces 429s. Ordinary requests use rotating `X-Forwarded-For` addresses so per-IP limits do not dominate. It is only for exercising panels; Phase 4 Locust tests will cover realistic user behavior.

For a host without `short.local` configured, forward the Ingress controller and pass the expected host to both scripts:

```sh
kubectl -n ingress-nginx port-forward service/ingress-nginx-controller 8080:80
BASE=http://localhost:8080 HOST_HEADER=short.local make traffic DURATION=120
```

| Scenario | Trigger and reset | Panels and expected alert |
|---|---|---|
| Chaos latency | `curl -X POST "$BASE/admin/chaos" -H "X-Admin-Token: $ADMIN_TOKEN" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"latency_ms":800,"error_pct":0}'`; reset with `curl -X DELETE "$BASE/admin/chaos" -H "X-Admin-Token: $ADMIN_TOKEN"` | p95 latency and latency percentiles rise; `ShortlyHighLatencyP95` fires. |
| Chaos errors | POST `{"latency_ms":0,"error_pct":30}` to `/admin/chaos`; reset with DELETE | 5xx rate and percentage rise; `ShortlyHighErrorRate` fires. |
| Errors release | `make bad-release-errors`; reset with `make rollback` | 5xx panels rise while readiness stays green; `ShortlyHighErrorRate` fires. |
| Crash release | `make bad-release-crash`; reset with `make rollback` after its rollout deadline | Pod restarts rise; `ShortlyPodCrashLooping` fires; `ShortlyPodsNotReady` may fire if enough replicas are unavailable. |
| Redis outage | `make redis-down`; restore with `make redis-up` | Redis up falls, pods become NotReady; `ShortlyRedisDown` and `ShortlyPodsNotReady` fire. |
| Rolling update | Start `make probe` and run `make good-release` in another terminal | Running versions briefly shows both tags; probe should show no failed requests. |

After each reset, use `make alerts` until the alert resolves. Finish with the `v1` baseline (`make rollback` as needed), `make smoke`, and `make alerts`.

## Troubleshooting

- **App target not discovered:** check the `ServiceMonitor` is in `urlshortener`, its namespace selector names that namespace, and the `shortly` Service has `app.kubernetes.io/name=shortly`, `app.kubernetes.io/component=api`, and a port named `http`. `make monitoring-status` shows target health.
- **Dashboard not appearing:** check the generated ConfigMap in `monitoring` has `grafana_dashboard="1"`, sidecar dashboards search `ALL`, and Grafana sidecar logs. Query `/api/search?query=Shortly` after a short provisioning delay.
- **CRD or large ConfigMap annotation errors:** use `make monitoring-apply`; it uses `kubectl apply --server-side -k monitoring/`.
- **Prometheus OOMKilled:** inspect `kubectl -n monitoring describe pod` and raise the Prometheus memory limit if the demo workload has grown. The default is 1 GiB.
- **Histogram panels empty:** verify `http_request_duration_seconds_bucket` and the `handler` labels at the running app's `/metrics`; this implementation uses the labeled histogram, not the high-resolution unlabeled histogram.
- **Datasource UID mismatch:** fetch Grafana's `/api/datasources` endpoint; the dashboard references the stack's actual default UID `prometheus`.
- **CPU panel empty:** inspect `container_cpu_usage_seconds_total` in Prometheus. Minikube cAdvisor exposes per-pod series without a container label; the dashboard uses `namespace`, `pod`, and `cpu="total"`.
- **HPA panel missing:** confirm kube-state-metrics is Running and query the `kube_horizontalpodautoscaler_status_*` series with `make promq`.

## Design decisions

- **Chart pin:** `91.8.2` was selected from the updated Prometheus Community repository search and is pinned in Makefile for repeatable installs.
- **Selector discovery:** all four Prometheus monitor/rule selectors disable Helm-release-only filtering so the app monitor and separately applied rules are selected across namespaces.
- **Scrape cadence:** Prometheus scrapes general stack targets every 15 seconds; the app monitor uses 10 seconds so rollout and demo changes appear promptly without a high scrape load.
- **Probe exclusion:** `/healthz` and `/readyz` run continually from Kubernetes. Excluding them from user ratios and latency keeps synthetic probe traffic from diluting errors or improving apparent latency.
- **Traffic guards:** error and latency alerts require sustained real-request traffic so an idle service does not divide by zero or flap on a handful of samples.
- **Short demo windows:** alert `for:` periods of 30 seconds to 1 minute make the scenario practical to observe. Production rules should use longer windows.
- **Minikube default alert:** the chart's `PrometheusMissingRuleEvaluations` warning fired intermittently during the lightweight single-node demo despite rule groups completing in milliseconds. It is disabled through the chart's supported `defaultRules.disabled` setting so the baseline alert view only shows actionable app alerts and the always-firing `Watchdog`.
- **Minikube cAdvisor labels:** the live cAdvisor series does not include a `container` label. The CPU query groups by app pod and pairs usage with the confirmed kube-state-metrics CPU request series.
- **Storage and memory:** Prometheus keeps two days of data, capped at 1 GB, on a 2 GiB default-class PVC. Grafana is stateless; single-replica Alertmanager and kube-state-metrics use small resource limits. Grafana's requested 256 MiB limit and a later 384 MiB limit both caused OOMKilled restarts with the chart 91.8.2 Grafana 13.2.3 image, so the current configuration allows 768 MiB. Node exporter and Minikube-incompatible control-plane scrapes are disabled.
- **Logging stretch:** Loki and a collector are skipped to keep this local stack small and focused. Use the existing `make logs` target to inspect the app's JSON logs with kubectl.
- **Credentials and notifications:** Grafana's `demo-grafana-pass` and the Alertmanager `null` receiver are local demo choices, not production credentials or notification routing.
